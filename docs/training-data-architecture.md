# Training Data Architecture — discovered interfaces (T-01 recon)

The design's Phase 0 acceptance: no guessed API contracts. Every interface
below was verified against the tree at the T-01 pre-fix head (662f974);
file:line cites are current as of that commit. The one place the design
was wrong is called out (§3).

## 1. Python SDK surface

`crates/sdk/python/python/aikoql/__init__.py` exports: `Agent`,
`McpClient`, `McpError`, `Transaction`, `Pool`, `PooledConnection`,
`PreparedStatement`, `BoundStatement`, adapters (crewai, langgraph), and
the optional PyO3 native module (`aikoql`, `__version__` — absent in
pure-MCP deployments).

- `Agent.connect(target)` (`agent.py:38`) — one entry point, two modes:
  a path (embedded, in-process PyO3) or `"host:port"` (MCP over TCP).
  Unified method surface: remember/get/find_similar/aikoql/create_index/
  relate/traverse/forget/health/metrics/batch/decide/agent_memory/
  discover_schema/session_init.
- `McpClient` (`mcp_client.py:129`) — the raw MCP client: connect/
  initialize/session_init/call_tool/begin, then one method per tool
  (remember, get, forget, find_similar, aikoql, prepare, relate,
  traverse, batch, health, discover_schema, decide, agent_memory,
  metrics, trace, explain, aikoql_stream). Every method is a thin
  `call_tool(name, args)` wrapper returning the tool's JSON envelope.
- Transactions: `begin(txn_id) -> Transaction` with execute/commit/
  rollback (`mcp_client.py:348`); `txn_begin/commit/rollback` tools
  (`tools/txn.rs`).
- `PreparedStatement` (`prepared.py`) — client-side `:name` placeholder
  validation; compiles on every execute.

## 2. MCP tool registry

`crates/services/api/mcp/src/tool_registry.rs` dispatches:
`remember, relate, forget, get, find_similar, trace, explain, traverse,
aikoql, metrics, discover_schema, health, agent_memory, session_init,
decide` plus the txn tools. This is the complete public tool surface the
Training Data Engine may call — nothing else is reachable over MCP.

## 3. Query path — TEXT aikoql (design-doc correction)

`McpClient.aikoql(query: str, subject=None)` sends `{"query": <text>}` to
`tool_aikoql` (`tools/query.rs:12`), which parses with
`aikoql_compiler::parser::parse`, executes CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE directly
via `kernel.remember`, and compiles everything else through the IR plan
pipeline. There is **no JSON query payload** on the public surface — the
design's `"language": "aikoql-json"` is wrong. The canonical schema
therefore pins `query_target = {"language": "aikoql", "query": "<text>"}`,
and T-05's query builder targets the compiler's text grammar.

## 4. Snapshot anchors

`tool_health` (`tools/admin.rs:190`) returns: `status, ready, journal_seq,
journal_lag_ms, object_count, connection_pool, audit_hash` (32-byte hex),
`uptime_seconds, semantic.state/detail`. `tool_metrics` (`admin.rs:78`)
returns journal sequence and object counts. T-02's knowledge revision is
`journal_seq + audit_hash` from this tool.

Two T-02 recon findings shape the implemented snapshot record
(`training/src/aikoql_training/snapshot.py`):

1. **Embedded health is a stub** — `Agent.health()` returns
   `{"ready": True, "status": "healthy"}` in embedded mode
   (`agent.py:187-190`); journal_seq/audit_hash exist only behind the
   MCP health tool. Snapshot capture therefore always goes over the
   server surface (`capture_from_agent` -> `Agent.health()`).
2. **No database identity is exposed** — the MCP initialize handshake
   carries only `serverInfo {name, version}` (`dispatcher.rs:100`);
   nothing names the database instance. `snapshot_id` binds
   `database_id + knowledge_revision`, with `database_id` an explicit
   operator parameter (the operator names the KB, e.g. "acmepay").

The invariant follows the design's split (§10): `snapshot_id` binds the
database state; `configuration_hash`, `source_manifest_hash`,
`generator_version` and `seed` are recorded fields — same snapshot +
same generator + same configuration + same seed = same example IDs.
`created_at` is metadata, excluded from identity.

## 5. Authorization

- Server: TCP token carries roles (`--tcp-token TOKEN::ROLES` convention,
  the P3-M9 trap); MCP sessions are tenant-scoped (R9 — session-injected
  caller identity with roles + tenant, `query.rs:21`).
- Client: `McpClient(host, port, token)`; `session_init(agent_id, run_id,
  tenant, roles)` (`mcp_client.py:315`); per-call `subject` argument,
  defaulting to `"query-user"` (`query.rs:17-20`).
- T-10's authorization scenarios therefore run as: same query, different
  subject/roles through the SAME public path — never by re-implementing
  ACL checks in Python.

## 6. KO serialization

`get(koid, subject)` returns the tool JSON envelope for one knowledge
object; KOIDs are 32-char hex. The exact envelope fields (origin, status,
confidence, valid_from/valid_to, version) are pinned by T-02's tests
against a live server, not restated here from memory.

## 7. Retrieval and context — an honest gap

The MCP surface exposes retrieval primitives (`find_similar`, `traverse`,
`aikoql`) but **no context-compiler tool**. The design's §15 assumes a
`ContextPackage` comes back from AIKOQL; at this tip it must be composed
from those primitives, or a context tool must be added to the server.
Decision deferred to T-06 with two options on the table: (a) adapter
composes ranked entities/facts/relations from the primitives; (b) a small
server change exposes the existing `crates/ingestion/src/context.rs`
compiler as a tool. Option (b) touches the core — it needs its own RED
and the product owner's call, per the no-core-changes scope of this
branch.

T-03 adds the traverse-shape finding: `Agent.traverse(koid, rel,
depth)` returns `{"hits": [...]}` over MCP but a flat list in embedded
mode; hits carry `koid, depth, rel_type, direction`, with direction
`"outbound"`/`"inbound"` (`knowledge.rs:88-105`). `client.scan_edges`
normalizes both surfaces and inverts inbound hits into (from, rel, to)
edges.

## 8. Fixtures and test patterns

The SDK's tests are the house pattern to follow: `test_agent_embedded.py`
runs against an embedded in-process server (`Agent.connect(tmp_path)` —
no socket, no spawn); `scripted.py` drives scripted server scenarios;
conformance rides a real binary. Training integration tests use embedded
first, one MCP full-path cell for the wire surface (T-06+).

T-03's live cell proves the pattern end to end: seed KOs → relate →
`scan_edges` → generate → assert every answer equals the live value,
all over the spawned MCP server. T-04 extends it to a 3-KO chain
(settlement → checkout → gateway): the multi-hop scenario's
`expected_path` re-verifies edge by edge against the traversed graph.

## 9. Crate anchors the design §3 assumed

Verified present at 662f974: `crates/ingestion/src/{resolution,
embedding, secret_filter, context, pipeline, merge, ingest_dir,
ingest_incremental}.rs`; `crates/compiler/src/{parser, planner,
semantic}`; `crates/runtime/src/backend.rs` routes production opening
through Storage V2. The design's reuse claims hold; training code must
not import any of these directly — the SDK/MCP surface is the boundary.
